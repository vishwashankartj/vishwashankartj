# Hi 👋, I'm Vishwashankar  

I build **AI Agents**, **RAG bots**, and occasionally break things just to fix them better 😄  
Always experimenting, always learning, always caffeinated.  

---

## ⚡ What I'm Up To  
- 🤖 Building AI agents that *actually* think (well… sorta)  
- 🧠 Playing with LLMs, embeddings, and all things “intelligent-ish”  
- 🔍 Exploring cool open-source projects & contributing when inspiration strikes  
- 🎯 Turning tiny ideas → fun projects → working prototypes  

---

## 🚀 Projects & Portfolio  
If you want to see the cool stuff I've been tinkering with 👇  
**✨ Portfolio:** https://vishwashankartj-portfolio.netlify.app/

My GitHub also has some chaotic experiments that eventually turned into something useful.  
Feel free to explore the repos — some are structured, some are… an adventure. 😅

## 🛠️ Tools I Play With  
- 🧩 Python, JS, TypeScript  
- ⚡ LLMs, Vector DBs, RAG pipelines  
- 🌀 PySpark, Databricks, AWS  
- 🐳 Docker (because containers > chaos)

⭐ Fun Fact: Half of my “quick experiments” turn into full projects.  
The other half? Let’s just call them “learning opportunities.” 😅
